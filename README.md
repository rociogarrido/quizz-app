# Quizz App

## How I worked on this project 👩🏼‍💻

🚀 My goal was to continue practicing TypeScript by building a Quizz App with React.

- I built this app based on the React / Typescript Tutorial and Course from Thomas Weibenfalk.

## How to navigate this project 🧭

- Responsive CSS using styled-components.
- The application fetches data from the Trivia API.

## Why I built the project this way 🚧

- I didn't use a state management library like Redux on purpose. For this app simple `useState` is sufficient. I realized that more and more projects don't use Redux anymore since GraphQL or react-query are often used for data management.
- Styled-components is a great library for styling. It includes an auto-prefixer, uses scoped classes, and allows a seamless integration with JS.
- My plan is to become a full-stack developer eventually. But for the beginning I focus on the frontend. That's why I decided to use an existing API rather to create a custom server. I have basic backend knowledge as well.

## If I had more time I would change this ⌛

- Testing is an essential part of production applications. Testing Library is the go-to library in the
  React community. I would covered the essential features of the app with tests.
